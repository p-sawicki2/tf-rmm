      "message": "This is a kind of slight repetition of code in caller of this function but there was a TODO to remove the init from caller.\n\nI think generally the attest state should not be changed from outside the attest module and it maybe possible to abstract the state machine and its manipulation within this module. Some refactor would be needed. Perhaps we can work on the refactor internally.",
