Change-log and Release notes
############################

******
v0.3.0
******

The following sections have the details on the release. This release has been
verified with `TF-A v2.9`_ release.

============================
New features in this release
============================

- Add support to create Realms which can make use of SVE, if present in
  hardware.

- Refactor the Stage 1 translation table library `lib/xlat` API to better
  fit RMM usage.  Also harden dynamic mapping via slot buffer mechanism by
  use of ``TRANSIENT`` software defined attribute.

- Add PMU support for Realms as described by RMM v1.0 Beta0 specification.

- Support getting DRAM info from the Boot manifest dynamically at runtime.

  * RMM can now support the 2nd DDR bank on FVP.

==========================
Build/Testing improvements
==========================

- Define a unit test framework using CppUTest for RMM.

- Add unittests for `granule`, `slot-buffer` and Stage 1 translation table lib
  `xlat`.

- Improve the ``fake-host`` mock capability by adding support for per PE sysreg
  emulation.

- Improve the VA to PA mock layer for ``fake-host``.

- Enable generation of gprof profiling data as part of ``fake-host`` runs.

- Improve the sample application on ``host-build`` platform by adding the cold
  attestation initialization flow. Also a sample minimal Realm create, run and
  destroy sequence is added to showcase the RMI calls involved.

- Further improvements to the the unit test framework :

  * Restore the sysreg state between test runs so each test gets a known
    sysreg state.
  * Add capability to test assertions.
  * Support dynamic behaviour for test harness depending on requirement.
  * Add support for coverage report generation as part of unit test run.

- Build improvements in RMM:

  * Move mbedTLS build from configure stage to build stage.
  * Simplify QCBOR build.
  * Fix build artefact directory path to better cater to multi-config builds.

=========================
Bug fixes in this release
=========================

- Remove HVC exit handling from RMI_REC_ENTER handler.

- Fix parameter in measurement_extend_sha512().

- Fix issues in `lib/xlat` for some corner cases.

- Mask MTE capability from `id_aa64pfr1_el1` so that Realms
  can see that MTE is not supported.

- Add isb() after writes to `cptr_el2` system register.

- Fix the granule alignment check on granule_addr.

- Fix some cppcheck warnings.

- Properly handle errors for granule (un)delegate calls.

- Fix the incorrect bit map manipulation for tracking VMID for realms.

- Fix some incorrect Block mapping cases in Stage 2 translation.

=================
Upcoming features
=================

- RMM EAC Specification alignment.

- Support Self-Hosted Debug Realms.

- Support FEAT_PAuth for Realms and utilize the same for RMM.

- Support LPA2 for Stage 2 Realm translation tables.

- Threat model covering RMM data flows.

- Enable Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) for source analysis.

- Save and restore SME/SME2 context belonging to NS Host. This allows NS Host
  to make use of SME/SME2 when Realms are scheduled.

============================
Known issues and limitations
============================

- The size of ``RsiHostCall`` structure is 256 bytes in the implementation
  and aligns to `RMM Beta1 specification`_ rather than the 4 KB size
  specified in `RMM Beta0 specification`_.

- The `RMM Beta0 specification`_ does not require to have a CBOR bytestream
  wrapper around the cca-platform-token and cca-realm-delegated-token, but
  the RMM implementation does so and this is aligned with later versions
  of the RMM specification (Beta2 onwards).

- The RMM config ``RMM_FPU_USE_AT_REL2`` does not work as intended and
  this config is disabled by default. This will be fixed in a future release.

******
v0.2.0
******

- This release has been verified with `TF-A v2.8`_ release.

- The release has the following fixes and enhancements:

   * Add support to render documentation on read-the-docs.
   * Fix the known issue with RSI_IPA_STATE_GET returning
     ``RSI_ERROR_INPUT`` for a `destroyed` IPA instead of
     emulating data abort to NS Host.
   * Fix an issue with RSI_HOST_CALL not returning back to Host
     to emulate a stage2 data abort.
   * Harden an assertion check for ``do_host_call()``.

- The other known issues and limitations remain the same as
  listed for v0.1.0_.

.. _TF-A v2.8: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tag/?h=v2.8.0

******
v0.1.0
******

-  First TF-RMM source release aligned to `RMM Beta0 specification`_.
   The specified interfaces : Realm Management Interface (RMI) and
   Realm Service Interface (RSI) are implemented which can attest
   and run Realm VMs as described by the `Arm CCA`_ Architecture.

=================
Upcoming features
=================

-  Support SVE, Self-Hosted Debug and PMU in Realms
-  Support LPA2 for Stage 2 Realm translation tables.
-  Threat model covering RMM data flows.
-  Enable Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) for source analysis.
-  Unit test framework based on :ref:`RMM Fake host architecture`.

============================
Known issues and limitations
============================

The following is a list of issues which are expected to be fixed in the future
releases of TF-RMM :

-  The size of ``RsiHostCall`` structure is 256 bytes in the implementation
   and aligns to `RMM Beta1 specification`_ rather than the 4 KB size
   specified in `RMM Beta0 specification`_.

-  The RSI_IPA_STATE_GET command returns error ``RSI_ERROR_INPUT`` for a
   `destroyed` IPA instead of emulating data abort to Host.

-  The `RMM Beta0 specification`_ does not require to have a CBOR bytestream
   wrapper around the cca-platform-token and cca-realm-delegated-token, but
   the RMM implementation does so.

-  When the ``RSI_ATTEST_TOKEN_CONTINUE`` call is interrupted and then resumed
   later by host via ``RMI_REC_ENTER``, the original SMC is replayed again
   with the original arguments rather than returning ``RSI_INCOMPLETE`` error
   code to realm. The result is that the interrupted RSI call is continued
   again till the RSI call is completed and then returns back to Realm with
   the appropriate error code.
