Threat Assessment
=================

The following threats were identified by applying STRIDE analysis on
each diagram element of the data flow diagram. The threats are related to
software and implementation specific to TF-RMM.

For each threat, we strive to indicate whether the mitigations are currently
implemented or not. However, the answer to this question is not always
straightforward. Some mitigations are partially implemented in the generic code
but also rely on the platform code to implement some bits of it. This threat
model aims to be platform-independent and it is important to keep in mind that
such threats only get mitigated if the platform properly fulfills its
responsibilities.

Also, some mitigations might require enabling specific features, which must be
explicitly turned on via a build flag.

The ``Pending actions?`` box highlights any action that needs to be done in
order to implement the mitigations.

|                        | | During the development stages of software it is |
|                        |   common to print all sorts of information on the |
|                        | | console, including sensitive or confidential    |
|                        |   information such as crash reports with detailed |
|                        | | information of the CPU state, current registers |
|                        |   values, privilege level or stack dumps.         |

|                        | | This information is useful when debugging       |
|                        |   problems before releasing the production        |
|                        | | version but it could be used by an adversary    |
|                        |   to develop a working exploit if left enabled in |
|                        | | the production version.                         |

|                        | | This happens when directly logging sensitive    |
|                        |   information and more subtly when logging based  |
|                        | | on sensitive data that can be used as a         |

|                        | |   i) Remove sensitive information logging.      |
|                        | |   ii) Do not conditionally log based on         |

|                        | |   iv) Do not log register contents which may    |

|                        |      should use the appropriate level of verbosity|
|                        | |    so as not to leak sensitive information in   |
|                        |      production builds.                           |

|                        | |    RMM provides the ``LOG_LEVEL`` build option  |
|                        |      which can be used to disable all logging.    |

| Mitigations            | | 1) Ensure that RMM protects the Realm memory by |
|                        |      using GPT service provided by EL3 Firmware   |
|                        | |    and appropriate Stage 2 protections. NS Host |
|                        |      must not be able to change or access Realm   |
|                        | |    memory.                                      |
|                        | | 2) NS host must not be able to change or access |
|                        |      Realm CPU register contents other than what  |
|                        | |    is allowed by RMM ABI. Root code should      |
|                        |      perform proper context switching of certain  |
|                        | |    subset of CPU registers as mandated in       |
|                        |      `RMM-EL3 Communication Interface`_ when      |
|                        | |    entering and exiting the Realm world.        |
|                        |      Similarly, RMM should context switch any     |
|                        | |    registers not managed by EL3 when            |
|                        |      entering/exiting Realms.                     |
|                        | | 3) The RME Architecture provides means to       |
|                        |      configure memory isolation to the Realm      |
|                        | |    world. RMM relies on Root code for correct   |
|                        |      RME setup. But when undelegating memory to   |
|                        | |    the Normal world, RMM needs to ensure that   |
|                        |      suitable memory scrubbing is implemented.    |
|                        | |    Also, RMM should ensure any architectural    |
|                        |      caches are invalidated before returning back |
|                        | |    to NS Host.                                  |

|                        |      RMM should issue a ``panic()``. This would   |
|                        | |    return to EL3 Firmware, keeping the          |
|                        |      availability of the overall system. It would |
|                        | |    be EL3 responsibility to decide how to       |
|                        |      proceed (e.g. by disabling the whole Realm   |
|                        | |    world).                                      |
|                        | | 2) EL3 Firmware needs to implement a watchdog   |
|                        |      mechanism to recover CPUs from Realm World.  |
+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

| Mitigations            | | 1) State machines should be tested for all the  |
|                        |      transitions and validated that all invalid   |
|                        | |    transitions and inputs are rejected.         |
|                        | | 2) The RMM ABI mandates pre and post conditions |
|                        |      for each ABI. The tests should verify that   |
|                        | |    these conditions are adhered to and          |
|                        |      implemented.                                 |

|                        |      realm. The NSHost must not be able to assign |

| Mitigations            | | 1) Yes.                                         |
| Implemented?           | |    This mitigation is inherently supported by   |
|                        |      the RMM ABI. SMC call from realm is always   |
|                        | |    associated to the Realm Descriptor (RD) and  |
|                        |      the RMM ABI does not allow spoofing of RD.   |
|                        | |    NS Host always has to pass the address of a  |
|                        |      valid RD to make requests to the             |
|                        | |    corresponding Realm. RMM maintains a global  |
|                        |      granule array and every granule linked to a  |
|                        | |    Realm has a specific State and reference     |
|                        |      count associated with it. Hence, the NS Host |
|                        | |    cannot associate an already Realm associated |
|                        |      granule to another Realm.                    |

| Mitigations            | | 1) The RMM specification mandates that sensitive|
|                        |      metadata like REC should be stored in Realm  |
|                        | |    PAS. Also, the specification does not allow  |
|                        |      NSHost to manipulate REC contents via RMI    |
|                        | |    once the associated Realm is Activated.      |
|                        |      Ensure that the RMM specification guidelines |
|                        | |    are enforced.                                |
|                        | | 2) Map sensitive metadata into RMM S1 tables    |
|                        |      only when manipulating the Realm/REC. Once   |
|                        | |    RMM is finished manipulating the metadata,   |
|                        |      unmap it from S1 tables. Thus the time window|
|                        | |    when RMM can access the metadata is kept to a|
|                        |      minimum thus reducing the opportunity to     |
|                        | |    corrupt the metadata.                        |

| Threat                 | | Misconfiguration of the hardware IPs and        |
|                        |   registers may lead to data leaks or incorrect   |
|                        | | behaviour that could be damaging on its own as  |
|                        |   well as being exploited by a threatening agent. |

|                        |   Misconfiguration of such elements could cause   |
|                        | | data leaks and/or system malfunction.           |
