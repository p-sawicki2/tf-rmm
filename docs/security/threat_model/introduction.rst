Introduction
============

Threat modeling is an important part of Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
that helps us identify potential threats and mitigations affecting a system.

In the next sections, we present the Threat Model for RMM, giving first a
description of the target of evaluation using a data flow diagram.
Then we provide a list of threats that we have identified based on the
data flow diagram and potential threat mitigations.
