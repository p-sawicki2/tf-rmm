      "message": "Hi Shruti, probably there is a case we are missing here and you could be right.\n\nSo there are these situations:\n\n1) Target REC is OFF    PSCI complete says denied   Calling rec gets denied   host psci complete succeeds\n2) Target REC is ON     PSCI complete says denied   Calling rec gets already ON host psci complete should succeed\n\n\nI think the 2nd situation is what you are referring to and yes, I think this condition (lines 401 - 403) should be removed.",
