The RMM can access the content of the auxiliary granules\n\t * only while holding a lock or reference to the parent REC granule\n\n... so it is worth adding a comment here that:\n\"The access to rec_aux granule is not protected by the lock in its granule but by the lock of the parent REC granule\".",
