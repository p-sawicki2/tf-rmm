      "message": "As discussed, xlat_tbl_info structure should contain information related to the table that it holds. The base VA on the structure should correspond to the first address mapped by that table. The context base VA (which, on the other hand is already stored in other structure) is of not much use here, as any operation on the table pointed by `xlat_tbl_info` should only affect to the VA space mapped only by that table, not to the whole VA space.\n\nI can change the name of the `base_va` field if you think it is misleading, though.",
