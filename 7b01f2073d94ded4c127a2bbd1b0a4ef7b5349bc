      "message": "Seemed to have lost the previous conversation on this. You mentioned you wanted to decouple the test from main library I think .\n\nThis is a simple functionality and the trouble with duplicating same code in lib and test is the potential to have issues in 2 places. The converse also can be argued, but the line I am taking at the moment is that for simple functionality (macros, inline functions, small utilities), no need to replicate in test.\n\nAlso, if we write a test to validate xlat_get_oa_from_tte() [perhaps using templates for input and expected output], this will ensure correctness of this function +  alleviate any concern that about using the function for validating tests.",
