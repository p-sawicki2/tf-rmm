      "message": "Making the name a bit more specific may be useful, say -\nSMC_RMM_PUSH_ATTEST_SIGN_REQ\n\nAlso I wonder whether the EL3 service need to have the \"HES\" in the name. Is there a possibility that this service can be completely implemented within EL3 ? So the service implementation is EL3 specific but the name captures the functionality provided ?\n\nJust a thought, dont do any rework in this direction yet.",
