As I see it, there are 2  aspects to test: whether the NS buffer is mapped correctly, can we write to it.\n\nFor the first part, use realm_util_ API to ensure mapping is done in slot_buffer.\n\nFor the second part , you could just write random values to one buffer and use this API and compare it. And perhaps ns_buffer_read can be combined in the test so we get 2 APIs tested at one.",

Check my answer to your comment on line 335 for more info.\n\nWRT the second point, I think it is not only enough with knowing if we can write, but also that we are writing properly, e.g. the offset passed is translated into the right offset within the granule, the size is respected and nothing above or below the area of the granule where we want to write has been affected. That\u0027s all that this test checks.\n\nWRT your last point, I think, when possible, we should keep the tests focused on one single API whenever possible, that way it should be easier to debug errors if something goes wrong and we can focus more easily on the specific aspects of that API",

      "message": "Actually, the point of this test is to check that the slot buffer library is able to keep different contexts for each CPU isolated (the slot buffer contexts are handled by the slot buffer module itself), so that having different PAs mapped to the same granule type (hence the same VA) at the same time on different CPUs is done properly.\n\nHowever, reviewing this test more closely, I\u0027m noticing that this is actually not tested at all: the callback used for the mapping returns the same address passed as argument, so it could happen that the library is doing the mapping all wrong or using the wrong context and that goes unnoticed here. And the same might be happening on other tests within this test group.\n\nOne solution that I see is that test_buffer_map_ret_pa() (or the counter one once I rename it as per your suggestions), doesn\u0027t return the same addr used as argument, but instead, once buffer_map_internal() has been called and a VA has been returned, instead of just ignore it, use a back conversion of that VA back to the \"PA\" that was mapped to it and return that address. If the slot buffer module used the right context, then the addr returned by test_buffer_map_ret_pa() should be same as used as argument, which will validate the tests.\n\nThoughts?",
