      "message": "Hmm, I think these are internal of the SIMD library implementation, which may not need to be tested by the unit tests. What is important is regardless of the implementation , does the SIMD as a component does what is meant to do ..\n\nmany of the fields manipulated as part of context_init will have a side effect on other APIs and affect its functionality, which is what the tests should do. \n\nFor eg: If the SFLAG_SAVED is not setup correctly as part of context init, then context_switch will not behave correctly. This can be tested for.\n\nThe details of implementation might change, but if the overall functionality remain s the same , then the tests need not be affected.\n\nwe can discuss further.",
