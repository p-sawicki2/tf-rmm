      "message": "Not sure i follow how this is an attack on the RMM. I dont think RMM availability is an asset of the RMM. Availability in CCA is entirely dependent on NS world so not sure this threat applies.\nIn my mind RMM has no availability attribute since it is purely a reactive agent and nobody depends on it to be available. It is either available if called, or not if not called upon.\nThe way you crash the RMM is by attempting to exploit code or affect integrity of data for example by trying to call the RMM in unintended ways to cause attacks. Those are nto availability attacks but attacks on code or data via tampering..",
