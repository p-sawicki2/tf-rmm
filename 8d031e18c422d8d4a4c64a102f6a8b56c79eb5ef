RMM needs to distinguish between lazy save-restore for SVE and\n * access to SME. Some cases:\n * 1. If SVE is disabled for the realm, then RMM needs to inject UNDEF.\n * 2. If SVE is enabled for the realm, RMM will restore SVE SIMD\n * context of the REC and will resume the Realm (this will get the CPU\n * out of streaming mode). While re-trying the faulting instruction\n * if it generates a SME exception, then RMM will inject undefined\n * abort since SME is not supported for Realm.\n */",
