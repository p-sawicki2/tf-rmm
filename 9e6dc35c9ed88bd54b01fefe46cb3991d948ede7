      "message": "We have previously discussed this but the xlat_lib only ever creates INVALID_DESC as 0x0 although as per VMSA arch, it only needs to set bits corresponding to DESC_MASK. The latter case is not allowed to happen when using the xlat lib. So this check then reduces to\n\nis_invalid \u003d (desc \u003d\u003d INVALID_DESC);\n\nWe could add a comment that this print is catering for xlat lib implementation wherein INVALID_DESC is 0x0 always.",
