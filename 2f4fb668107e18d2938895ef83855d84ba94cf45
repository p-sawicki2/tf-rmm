      "message": "The RMM granule state machine will not allow undelegating a granule which is not in state \"delegated\". \n\nWhen a granule is transitioned from \"delegated\" to any other state like \"REC, RD, RTT, DATA\" and then transitioned back to \"delegated\", there is a memzero() done.\n\nSee this query https://github.com/search?q\u003drepo%3ATF-RMM%2Ftf-rmm+memzero\u0026type\u003dcode\n\nDid you notice any case when a buffer was non zeroed when undelegate() was called?",
