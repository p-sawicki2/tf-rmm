We might need some guidance in the documentation if this is to be set up by user.\n\nAlso, another alternative could be to add this variable to lib/common/CMakeLists.txt as an `INTERFACE` which will then be inherited by all the lib components. Could you let me know whether that will work ?",

This patch is part of the work needed to get the RMM compiled in the Yocto environment.  I have submitted the RMM recipe to the meta-arm yocto mailing list.\n\nI will look at your INTERFACE proposal and will get back to you.",
