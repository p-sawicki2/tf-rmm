  Currently, Shrinkwrap has the limitation that it needs to have a non-null path
  for all repositories in order to be able to clean a given configuration, even
  if such path is incorrect and/or not needed for the cleaning process.

  rmm.yaml provides a null path for ``RMM_SRC`` btvar, but the clean command
  does not accept any btvar. Hence, Shrinkwrap clean will fail when invoked for
  the rmm-tftf.yaml config. This overlay is therefore meant to be used to
  overwrite the RMM sourcedir path with a dummy path so shrinkwrap clean will
  pass.

build:
  rmm:
    sourcedir: /dev/null
