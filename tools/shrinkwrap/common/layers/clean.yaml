  Currently, Shrinkwrap has the limitation that it needs to have a non-null path
  for all repositories in order to be able to clean a given configuration, even
  if such path is incorrect and/or not needed for the cleaning process.

  Because rmm.yaml provides a null path for the RMM repository, which
  must be overwriten through the ``RMM_SRC`` btvar but the clean command
  does not accept any btvar, shrinkwrap clean will fail when invoked for the
  rmm-tftf.yaml. This overlay is therefore meant to be used to overwrite
  the RMM sourcedir path with a dummy path so shrinkwrap clean will not crash.

build:
  rmm:
    sourcedir: /dev/null
