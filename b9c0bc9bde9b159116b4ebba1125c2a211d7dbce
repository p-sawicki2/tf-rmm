      "message": "Future features in RMM may need some space (e.g. 2 bits) in granule object.\n\nAssuming that this space is not needed for RTT granules, they can be borrowed from REFCOUNTER (only RTT granule needs 9 bit ref. counter, the other types need less or none).\n\nDo you see any problem if in future we make the size of refcounter dependent on granule type?",
