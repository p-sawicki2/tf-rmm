      "message": "The EL3-RMM interface itself is versioned and binds all the structures and the sizes. Now since this is an optional interface, it does have a case to have separate versioning. \n\nNeed to think further :\n1. Will all optional EL3-RMM SMCs need to keep its own versioning ? If that is the case, will it be problematic for RMM to work out compatibility with EL3 firmware.\n\n2. The RMM-EL3 FID space is limited. If we do get more of these optional SMCs in future, do we need a more optimal FID strategy for optional SMCs ?",

My assumption is that EL3 will only read the specified size.\n\nIf at all this is needed, it may be faster to use `granule_memzero_mapped` on the buffer and then copy the request to it.",
