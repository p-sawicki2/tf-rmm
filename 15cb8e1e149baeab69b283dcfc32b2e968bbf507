      "message": "When looking the XLAT library, it\u0027s noticeable that assertions are used quite frequently without returning the error code. Typically, assertions are employed to signify programming errors and ensure that pre-conditions are met and never violated during runtime (alerting you to errors that must never occur in the first place). Therefore, it might not be necessary to retain these checks in the release build. However, this patch appears to address programming errors, justifying the use of assertions.\n\nI think we have the flexibility to include as many assertions as desired, as it doesn\u0027t affect the release build and is intended solely for development purposes, and it is a programmer\u0027s choice.\n\nAny thoughts?",

For the other arguments, if we are not sure whether the arguments have been checked properly at the trust boundary , then we should retain the runtime checks.
