The version of RMM-EL3 interface need to be bumped up. The docs also need update.\n2. SMC discovery from EL3 as part of boot.\n3. Failure path if SMC not found in EL3 - SMC_UNK may be returned from EL3.",

I would like to do this as patches on top of this series if that is fine.\nFor #3, isnt it already take care of? It is either 0 or something else, and code paths will fail if they have unexpected error code (ie other than EAGAIN).",

The availability of these SMCs will need to be queried via another RMM_EL3_FEATURES like SMC.\n\nSince the SMCs are optional , it may return SMC_UNK at this point unless the RMM_EL3_FEATURES is defined in such a way that if hte feature is present, then the SMCs must be present.",
