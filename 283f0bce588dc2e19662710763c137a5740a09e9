The version of RMM-EL3 interface need to be bumped up. The docs also need update.\n2. SMC discovery from EL3 as part of boot.\n3. Failure path if SMC not found in EL3 - SMC_UNK may be returned from EL3.",

I would like to do this as patches on top of this series if that is fine.\nFor #3, isnt it already take care of? It is either 0 or something else, and code paths will fail if they have unexpected error code (ie other than EAGAIN).",

The availability of these SMCs will need to be queried via another RMM_EL3_FEATURES like SMC.\n\nSince the SMCs are optional , it may return SMC_UNK at this point unless the RMM_EL3_FEATURES is defined in such a way that if hte feature is present, then the SMCs must be present.",

      "message": "To keep the version number update sane, \nI think RMM_EL3_FEATURES would need to be added to the RMM-EL3 comms first (with a minor number bump) and then the HES pull and Push SMCs added with another minor version bump. \n\nRegarding the RMM_EL3_FEATURES ,there are potentially 2 ways to implement:\n\n1. It takes the optional SMC FID as an argument and then returns SUCCESS/ERROR.\n2. No arguments are taken, and EL3 returns a bit mask , and each optional SMC has an allocated bit. If the bit is set, then the SMC is available, if unset then the SMC is not present.\n\nBoth has pros and cons. 2 has the advantage that we can retrieve all the optional services with one SMC call and hence I think this may be better approach.\n\nAs a heads up, I am on holiday for 2 weeks from tomorrow .",
