      "message": "I\u0027m looking at this change log as part of the high level Firmware-A v2.11 release security review activity required by Janus release assessment. Looking just at the New Features section nothing leaps out when comparing against the current threat model.\n\nAs TF-RMM and RME support in TF-A are still experimental the security review is more relaxed.\n\nFor the future one suggestion is that TF-RMM look to adopt the Conventional Commits mechanism as TF-A does. This aids in the auto generation of the initial changelog draft and has links to the commits. This does not stop the adding of more text to provide more context of work being delivered in the release.\n\nBeing able to easily follow through to the actual code commit is quite useful capability. I appreciate this could be achieved by also reviewing at the same time the git log for the release period but that can be quite laborious and error prone.\n\nBack to the Security review this complete that activity. \n\nI would suggest when TF-RMM reaches the v1.0 release a fuller security review is performed.",

This aids in the auto generation of the initial changelog draft and has links to the commits. This does not stop the adding of more text to provide more context of work being delivered in the release.\n\nActually, we use the conventional commit message syntax for commits but not the tooling associated with it. This is due to the sheer number of dependencies needed by the tooling and security vulnerabilities associated with them (as seen in dependabot weekly alerts for TF-A).\n\nWe have custom tooling to check adherence to commit message format in TF-RMM. Perhaps some of the host tooling can be reused for generating commit messages for release, but currently this is not considered as there are not many external contributions to the project.\n\n\u003e  TF-RMM reaches the v1.0 release a fuller security review is performed.\n\nFor the TF-RMM , the plan is for a continual review rather than a point review during release. This is already being performed, applicable for for past releases and I dont expect this to be different for future release.",

      "message": "Thats fine Soby, although the periodic Dependabot JAVA alerts can be surprising when they occur they don\u0027t effect the supply chain for the Firmware. A way to isolate these from the main repository would be better though to avoid that uneasy feeling. I\u0027m sure something could be done with a little bit of effort.\n\nRegarding v1.0 security review, its good to see the incremental approach that will make the v1.0 release easier.",

But it is low risk. \n\nFor what its worth, Conventional commit tooling is a bit too bloated IMO.  My view is we can use the ideas of conventional commit but not the tooling as already done in TF-RMM.",
