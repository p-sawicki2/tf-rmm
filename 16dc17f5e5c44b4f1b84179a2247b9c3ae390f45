      "message": "Hi Raghu,\nThinking about this more. There is a potential way to decouple aux granule mapping from hes_attest_pull-response.\n\nIf hes_attest_pull_response can return a error code to indicate that a response is available, then also return a pointer to the hes_attest_response_s, then  the caller can decide whether it belongs to current realm or map in another realm as required.\n\nFor now this sequence is OK. this can be a future enhancement. A TODO note to mention this potential solution here will be good.",

If that happens, absolutely, we can make the attest_rsp structure the interface between attestation lib and runtime, for the final operation to push it to the appropriate REC (which must live in runtime due to rec header dependencies, perhaps via a call back provide to attestation lib).\nI will do this as soon as the rest of the patches merge.",
