      "message": "I would rewrite the bullets as:\n\n* When called as part of RMI_RTT_CREATE, the S2TTE will need to have all the attributes set by RMM set to \u00270\u0027\n\n* When called as part of RMI_RTT_FOLD, the S2TTE is coming from an existing block entry, so the S2TTE_NS attribute is expected to be set.\n\nI would also add this comment to s2tte_create_assigned_ns() as otherwise its description is misleading.\n\nAll the above said, I\u0027m not sure if this would be the right patch: because of the second bullet, we cannot enforce the first one (S2TT_NS is not checked on the assertion). As long as we all are OK with that, I guess there is no problem. Otherwise I guess we should either\n\n* create another version of s2tte_create_assigned_ns() to be called only on the RMI_RTT_FOLD case or\n\n* pass an argument to s2tte_create_assigned_ns() indicating whether it is being called from RMI_RTT_CREATE or RMI_RTT_FOLD so it can do the proper checks.\n\nEither way seems a bit convoluted to me, so happy to skip the check on S2TT_NS, but in that case, I guess we should add, on the first bullet, that the S2TTE will need to have all the attributes set but RMM, with the exception of S2TT_NS, to \u00270\u0027.",
